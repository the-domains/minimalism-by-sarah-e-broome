Good Friday in West Bay, Dorset...

Today was a beautiful sunny day here in Dorset, certainly it would seem that it will have been the best day of the Easter Weekend, judging by the weather reports. I wanted to carry on with my Minimalism project today, so armed with my camera my husband and I headed off down the road to West Bay. 

By far, my favourite shot of the day was that of a Herring Gull flying out of the direct sunlight. I like the effect. Not strictly minimalist but for today, it is good enough!
